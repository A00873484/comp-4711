A sailing is a trip between to two end-points of the Southern Gulf
Islands ferry run, namely Long Harbour (Salt Spring) and Tsawwassen 
(mainland).

Each sailing has an origin and destination port, departure and arrival
times between these, and then a days attribute specifying which days of
the week this sailing applies to.

A sailing may have any number of stops along the way.

Add one more possible stop at Fulford Harbour on each of the sailings.
