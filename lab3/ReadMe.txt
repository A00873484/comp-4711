We added controllers first, bingo, guess, and welcome within a folder called last.

In the controllers we put default functions called index() that would generate a page if the controller was routed to but to no specific function in the controller. 

In some controllers we added functions that would generate a page if routed to directly.

In routes.php we added some routes for certain pages that would call a controller or a function in a controller.
