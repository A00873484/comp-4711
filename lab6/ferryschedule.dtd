A sailing is a trip between the two end-points of the Southern Guld Islands ferry run, namely Long Harbour (Salt Spring), and Tsawwassen (mainland).
Each sailing has an origin & destination port, departure and arrival times between these, and then a days attribute specifying which days of the week this sailing applies to.
A sailing may have any number of stops along the way.
