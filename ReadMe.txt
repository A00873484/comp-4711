	after you clicked the submit button on the page with the twitter follow button you get to a page where you can share 		the contents of the page using facebook, twitter, or email. And you can print out the contents using another button
	(allowing you to print/share the departure schedule you just created) all such buttons are located on the right side 		of the screen, found at "https://www.addthis.com/get/sharing" where I picked the free sharing sidebar

fourth task
	in the front page you can click the lab5 button that leads you to a page with the ability to share the page contents 		with facebook, twitter, linkedin, and email. Located right under the header.  
	I went to "http://www.sharethis.com/get-sharing-tools/#" to get the share buttons and excluded the pininterest, and 		sharethis buttons since the site dosnt have anthing of relation to these things
